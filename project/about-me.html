    <p>I am a senior student in Syracuse University. My major is Information Management and Technology. I want to be a web developer.</p>
    <p>In my free time I listen to musics or watch YouTube videos. </p>
    <p> I love shopping and watching funny shows whenever I am nervuse about something.</p>
    <p>I have part time job at Destiny USA mall. I am working with an amazing team.</p>
    <p>In this website i am sharing everithing I am going through in my last year at Syracuse University. I start my first semester of senior year, by taking 18 credits.
        I have this feeling that if I did not put this much pressure on myself I would have enjoy senior year so much more. </p>
    <p> Thank God, I have so many great professors who understand my situation and support me to go through everything smoothly.</p>
