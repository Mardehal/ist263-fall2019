    <h1>What does my senior year look like?</h1>
    <p>
        I made a mistake of taking 18 credits in this semester, and now I feel overwhelmed. I should have put less pressure on myself and took less credits.
        However, I wanted to be able to graduate on May 2020.

    <p>
        In all of the weekends I always go to schools library to work on my homworks right after my work.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am always on campus during the weekends evenings until late night, close to midnight, finishing up homeworks.
