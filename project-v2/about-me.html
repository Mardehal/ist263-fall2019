                    <p>I am a senior year student at Syracuse University. My major is Information Management and Technology, and my concentration is Web design and Management. I took courses that taught me so many exciting things about web development. I want to be a successful web developer in future.</p>
                    <p id="title">
                        I am coding this website myself to use it as an example of my work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During the process of coding this website I enjoyed working with HTML and CSS.
                    </p>
                    <p>On my free time I listen to musics or watch YouTube videos. </p>
                    <p> I love shopping and watching funny shows whenever I am nervous about something.</p>
                    <p> Doing my makeup and watching makeup related videos is another thing I enjoy doing on my free times.</p>
                    <p>I have a part time job at Destiny USA mall. I am working with an amazing team.</p>
                    <p>In this website, which I am coding it myself, I am sharing everything I am going through on my last year at Syracuse University. I started my first semester of senior year, by taking 18 credits.And I know that if I did not put this much pressure on myself I would have enjoy senior year so much more. </p>
                    <p> In order to be able to graduate on May 2020, I had to take another 18 credits on Spring semester as well. While I am sure it worth it, being a full time student and working part time at the same time is hard.</p>
                    <p> You will learn about my job later on my website. </p>
                    <p> Thank God, I have so many great professors so far, who understand my situation and support me to go through everything smoothly.</p>
