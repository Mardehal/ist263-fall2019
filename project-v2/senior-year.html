            <p> First lets look at the nice picture I took of my home college building:</p>
            <img src="hindshall.jpg" style="width:400px;" alt= "Hinds Hall"/>

            <p>
                I made a mistake of taking 18 credits in this semester, and now I feel overwhelmed. I should have put less pressure on myself and took less credits.
                However, I wanted to be able to graduate on May 2020. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In all of the weekends I always go to schools library to work on my homworks right after my work.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am always on campus during the weekends evenings until late night, close to midnight, finishing up homeworks.

            </aside>
            <p> As much as I love my major, taking four class in Information Management and Technology is really challenging. I am trying my best to be great in all of my classes. </p>
            <p>This is semester I took these classes:</p>
            <ul class='b'>
                <li><a href="https://ischool.syr.edu/classes/fall-2019/class/1201.17169/"> IST 263</a></li>

            </ul>
            <p>
                Something else I want you to know about me is I am working in a part time job in Sephora at Destiny USA mall.
                I love my job and the team that I am working with.
            </p>
            <p>
                During the Halloween we decided to have theme each weekend, and be creative in our makeup look. 
                These are different looks I came up during the October 2019. 
            </p>
            <div class="row" id="Halloween">
                <div class="col-sm-3" style="background-color:rosybrown"> <img src="halloweenpic.jpg" style="width:400px;" alt="Halloween Picture" /></div>
                <div class="col-sm-3" style="background-color:rosybrown"> <img src="halloweenpic2.jpg" style="width:400px;" alt="Halloween Picture#2" /></div>
                <div class="col-sm-3" style="background-color:rosybrown"> <img src="halloweenpic3.jpg" style="width:400px;" alt="Halloween Picture#3" /></div>
            </div>
            <p> In addition to all of my classes and my part time job, I have been attending to different events across the campuse.</p>
            <p id="title"> 
                Syracuse Universty Fall 2019 involvement fair:
            </p>
            <p>In this fair I got to know different organizations that are exist all across the campus. I shared my email address to some of them so I get involved with their activities.</p>
        
            <img src="campus.jpg" style="width:400px;" alt="SU campus"/>
        
            <p id="title">
                The organizations that I joined so far are:</p>
            <ul class="a">            
                
                <li>ISA</li>
                <li>TSA</li>
                <li>MSA</li>
            </ul>
        
            <p> To add to my activities on campus, I just attend to Ali Azimi's concert. He is a singer that has his own way of playing music. He came to Syracuse University to play for us in his New York Tour.</p>
