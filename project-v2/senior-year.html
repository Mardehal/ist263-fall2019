            <h2>What does my senior year look like?</h2>

            <p> First lets look at the nice picture I took of my home college building:</p>

            <p>
                I made a mistake of taking 18 credits in this semester, and now I feel overwhelmed. I should have put less pressure on myself and took less credits.
                However, I wanted to be able to graduate on May 2020. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In all of the weekends I always go to schools library to work on my homworks right after my work.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am always on campus during the weekends evenings until late night, close to midnight, finishing up homeworks.
            </p>
            <p>Me working on homeworks on weekends:</p>

            </aside>
            <p> As much as I love my major, taking four class in Information Management and Technology is really challenging. I am trying my best to be great in all of my classes. </p>
            <p>This is semester I took these classes:</p>
            <ul class='b'>
                <li><a href="https://ischool.syr.edu/classes/fall-2019/class/1201.17169/"> IST 263</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://ischool.syr.edu/classes/fall-2019/class/1201.17333/"> IST 346</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://ischool.syr.edu/classes/fall-2019/class/1201.17129/"> IST 335</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://ischool.syr.edu/classes/fall-2019/class/1201.17311/"> IST 359</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p> In addition to all of my classes and my part time job, I have been attending to different events across the campuse.</p>
            <p> Syracuse Universty Fall 2019 involvement fair:
            </p>
            <p>In this fair I got to know different organizations that are exist all across the campus. I shared my email address to some of them so I get involved with their activities.</p>
        
            <img src="campus.jpg" style="width:400px;" alt="SU campus"/>
        
            <p>The organizations that I joined so far are:</p>
            <ul class="a">            
                
                <li>ISA</li>
                <li>TSA</li>
                <li>MSA</li>
            </ul>
        
            <p> To add to my activities on campus, I just attend to Ali Azimi's concert. He is a singer that has his own way of playing music. He came to Syracuse University to play for us in his New York Tour.</p>
