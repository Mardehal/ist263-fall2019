                    <p> First lets look at the nice picture I took of my home college building:</p>
                    <p>School of Information Studies building is located in Quad on campus. My favorite parts in this building is icafe and Ice Box.</p>
                    <p>Students love to hang out in these places and studing.</p>
                    <p>I have so many great memories in these places that I am going to miss them, after I graduate.</p>

                I made a mistake of taking 18 credits in this semester, and now I feel overwhelmed. I should have put less pressure on myself and took less credits.
                However, I wanted to be able to graduate on May 2020. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In all of the weekends I always go to schools library to work on my homworks right after my work.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am always on campus during the weekends evenings until late night, close to midnight, finishing up homeworks.

            <p> As much as I love my major, taking four classes in Information Management and Technology is really challenging. I am trying my best to be great in all of my classes. </p>
            <p>This is semester I took these classes:</p>

                Something else I want you to know about me is I am working in a part time job in Sephora at Destiny USA mall.
                I love my job and the team that I am working with.
            </p>
            <p>
                During the Halloween we decided to have theme each weekend, and be creative in our makeup look. 
                These are different looks I came up during the October 2019.
